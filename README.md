Contributing
---

Contributions are very welcome and much appreciated.

Please follow the existing conventions and style, in order to keep the code as readable as possible.
If using IntelliJ/Android Studio, the default Java code styling and `Code > Reformat Code` should to the trick
(make sure to tick `Optimize Imports`, too).

If you plan to work on a new feature, create an issue, so we can discuss it first.
